While you was gone you must have done a lot of favors
You've got a whole lot of things I don't think
That you could ever have paid for
While you've been busy crying

About my past mistakes
I've been busy trying to make a change
I made a change
I've been riding with the ghost

I've been doing whatever he told me
I've been looking door to door to see
If there was someone who'd hold me
I never met a single one who didn't see through me

None of them could love me if they thought they might lose me
Unless I made a change
See I ain't getting better. I am only getting behind
I am standing on a crossroad trying to make up my mind

I'm trying to remember how it got so late
Why every night pain comes from a different place
Now something's got to change
I put my foot to the floor

To make up for the miles I've been losing
See I'm running out of things
I didn't even know I was using
And while you've been busy

Learning how to complain
I've been busy learning
How to make a change
I made it (almost) (again)
